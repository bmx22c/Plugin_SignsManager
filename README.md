# Signs Manager

Signs Manager, like its name says, aims to help you manage signs on your maps by batch modifying blocks !
It is a fork of the [Items & Blocks Counter](https://openplanet.dev/plugin/blocksitemscounter) plugin by Beu.

## Limitations / Bugs
- Start / Finish blocks tend to list signs that can't be applied
- Items cannot be modified (yet)
- Cannot enter a URL (yet)
- Mass batch sign modify is not made (yet)
- Empty user folder will crash the plugin (to be fixed)
